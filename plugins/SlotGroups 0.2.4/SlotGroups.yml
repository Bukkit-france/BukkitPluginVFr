# This option is only here to help with a Permissions 3 SQL issue.
# If you're not running Permissions 3.x in SQL mode, ignore it.
# 
# This is the group whose permissions are used if Permissions does not report 
#   a group for a user.  This seems to happen in some cases with 
#   Permissions 3.x and SQL databases.
  defaultgroup: Default

# This is where you define the slot groups.
# If you do not define any slot groups, the plugin will disable itself.
# The first one listed will be used as the default group, all users without any 
#   slot group permissions will be put in this group.
# The list is checked from the bottom up, and will return the lowest slot on the
#   list a user has access to.
# 
# Syntax:
# slots:
#   - name: Default
#     size: 25
#     message: 'The server is full.'
#     children: []
#     login: true
#     permission: default
# 
# Name is the display name used for the slot group.
#
# Size is the number of slots in the group.
#
# Message is the kick message used when this group is full.
#
# Children is a list of groups that this group inherits from. Inheritence is 
#   recursive, so don't add children that are already inherited by other children.
#
# Login determines if this group can login or not.  True is default and means 
#   that slot group is allowing logins.  False will deny all users in that group
#   the ability to login.
#
# Override allows this user group to join even if the server is in lockdown mode.
#   For normal users, this defaults to false.  For users who have access to the 
#   lockdown commands, this defaults to true.  You probably don't need to change this.
#
# Permission is the name of the permission node for this slot group, in the 
#   format slotgroup.group.<name>
#   In the examaple above, the permission node would be slotgroup.group.default
#
# Below are the values I use on my server.

#All default/new users.  Lowest priority and least likely to be able to join.
